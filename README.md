##Publication

Gimme is unpublished. A manuscript is in preparation.

##Download

Source code is available at https://github.com/ged-lab/gimme.git.

##Installation

Run python setup.py install in the main directory to download and install required packages.

##Running Gimme

Gimme should be able to run on any platform with Python 2.7 interpreter.

You can simply run

    python ./src/gimme.py <input file>

##Input

Gimme can read an input file in PSL or BED format.
Use gff2bed.py in utils directory to convert GFF file to BED file.

***Note, Gimme currently ignores strandedness of a transcript. All predicted gene models are in positive strand
Strandedness will be supported in the next release.***

##Output

Output is written to standard output in BED format, which can be visualized
on UCSC genome browser or other browsers.

By default, gene models built by Gimme contain a minimum number of isoforms.
Use --max or -x to force Gimme to report a maximum number of isoforms.
You can also use a script in utils to find a minimum set of transcripts.
See Utilities for more detail.

##Example

Assemble transcripts from sample data

    python ./src/gimme.py sample_data/sample.psl > sample.bed

Obtain a maximum number of isoforms

    python ./src/gimme.py -x sample_data/sample.psl > sample.max.bed

Run Gimme with multiple input files

    python ./src/gimme.py sample1.psl sample2.psl sample3.psl > sample.all.bed

Run Gimme with user defined parameters

    python ./src/gimme.py --min_utr=200 --max_intron=100000 --gap_size=15 sample.psl > sample.all.bed

See a program's help

    python ./src/gimme.py -h or --help

##Parameters

GAP_SIZE, --gap_size=50
Introns smaller than GAP_SIZE) are filled to construct a more complete exon.

MAX_INTRON, --max_intron=300000
The maximum intron size (bp) allowed. A transcript is split into smaller parts
if it contains an intron longer than MAX_INTRON.

MIN_UTR, --min_utr=100
Alternative UTRs smaller than MIN_UTR are merged to overlapping exons.

MIN_TRANSCRIPT_LEN, --min_transcript_len=300
The minimum length (bp) for multiple exon transcript.

MIN_SINGLE_EXON_LEN, --min_single_exon_len=500
The minimum length (bp) for a single exon gene.

MAX_ISOFORMS, --max_isoforms=20
The maximum number of isoforms allowed without -x option.
Gimme searches for a minimum number of isoforms if the maximum number exceeds MAX_ISOFORMS.

-x, --max
Tell Gimme to search for report all putative isoforms.

--debug
Run Gimme with parameters set for debugging.

-v, --version
Print out a version number.

-h, --help
Print out a help message.

##Running Tests

Run nosetests in the main directory to run all tests.

##Utilities

Gimme contains many useful utilities that work with PSL, BED and SAM format.
Some programs are useful for building gene models.
Others are useful for working with reads, assembly sequences etc.
